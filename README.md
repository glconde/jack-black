This is a simple game of Black Jack[1] so no splitting or side bets.

The objective is to draw upto five(5) cards and get to or closer to 21 without getting over.

Getting over 21 is called bust and the player loses.

The following is the point system for cards:
<ul>
    <li> 2-9 > has the equivalent point based on it's card face. e.g. 3 = 3 pts </li>
    <li> 10, J, Q, K are 10 points each. </li>
    <li> Aces can be 1 or 11, depending on the current total points. 1 is used if drawn and the total points gets the score over 21. e.g. when current hand is 10, J, drawing an ace will use 1 instead of 11. </li>
</ul>

Special Rules:
<ul>
    <li>In case of tie, the house/dealer always wins.</li>
    <li>If the dealer gets 21 or Ace + any face card or 10, dealer automatically wins regardless.</li>

Default settings (customizable):
<ul>
    <li>player credits are set to 100 but maybe changed via code or other modification method.</li>
    <li>every loss deducts 50 from credits and the game ends when the player has 0 funds.</li>
</ul>
